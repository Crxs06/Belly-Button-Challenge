# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

This project is an interactive dashboard that visualizes data on the microbes (OTUs) found in human belly buttons. Using D3.js and Plotly.js, it allows users to explore the top 10 bacteria types found in different test subjects.

Users can select a test subject ID from a dropdown menu to view:
- A horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 OTUs in their sample
- A bubble chart displaying all OTUs found
- A panel with demographic information for the selected subject

The data is loaded from an external JSON source and updates automatically when a new sample is selected. All the JavaScript code is contained in one file (`static/js/app.js`), and the project is styled with Bootstrap for a clean, responsive layout.
