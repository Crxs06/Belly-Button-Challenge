# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

This project is an interactive data visualization dashboard that explores the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs microbial species (OTUs) found in human navels. Built using D3.js and Plotly.js, the dashboard allows users to select a test subject ID from a dropdown menu and view the top 10 OTUs found in that individual's sample via a horizontal bar chart. A dynamic bubble chart shows the full OTU breakdown, and a metadata panel provides demographic information for the selected subject.

The data is fetched from an external JSON URL using D3, and charts update in real-time when a new sample is selected. The dashboard is fully responsive and deployed via GitHub Pages for easy access. This assignment demonstrates core skills in JavaScript, API data handling, DOM manipulation, and interactive data visualization. All logic is contained within a single JavaScript file (`app.js`) located in the `static/js/` directory. The layout and functionality closely follow project guidelines from the UCI Data Analytics Bootcamp, Module 14 Challenge.
